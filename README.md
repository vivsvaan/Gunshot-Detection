# Gunshot Detection
A Sound Detection and Classification System

### Overview
It is a deep-learning based sound detection and classification system focused on detecting and isolating sounds of gunshot and gunfire from the other ambient
environmental sounds. 

The sound model would consist of an image classifier which would take a sound sample spectrogram as an input and classify it among ambient and dangerous (gunfire) sounds. 

For any positive identification of a gunfire, the current location of the recording device would be sent to the pre-registered contacts and to the nearest police stations.
